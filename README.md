# Idler

Just a super simple keyboard idler written in Python, to assist in hands-free queueing/preventing AFK timeouts during the FFXIV Endwalker expansion launch.

Just run the provided Windows `exe`, and Idler will press the escape button 4 times whenever it doesn't detect any user keypresses for ten minutes. It will log any keys it detects to the provided Windows terminal window, and it will also print a message there whenever it activates due to inactivity.

Piece of cake! Go save Eorzea!
